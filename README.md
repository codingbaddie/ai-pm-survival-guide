## Manifesto
We are entering an era where **coding is cheap, but thinking is expensive**.
As AI models become more powerful, the role of a Product Manager (and AI-Native Developer) shifts from "managing execution" to **"managing intelligence."**

This repository is not a collection of prompts. It is a collection of **strategies, mental models, and protocols** for humans who want to lead AI, not be replaced by it.

## 📖 The Protocol Library

Here, I document the methodologies for setting boundaries, defining architecture, and enforcing critical thinking in AI collaboration.

| Article Title | Key Concept | Languages |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **Reclaiming Sovereignty: Why Your AI Needs a Strict Product Manager** | Defines the "Tiered Engagement Model" and provides the `.cursorrules` configuration to force AI into critical thinking mode. | [English](./articles/Boundaries_with_AI_EN.md) / [中文](./articles/Boundaries_with_AI_ZH.md) |
| **AI-Native Workflow Guide** | A comprehensive guide on integrating AI deeply into your product management workflow, from PRD to code. | [English](./articles/AI_Native_Workflow_Guide_EN.md) / [中文](./articles/AI_Native_Workflow_Guide.md) |
| **Google Workspace Guide** | How to leverage AI within the Google Workspace ecosystem for maximum productivity. | [English](./articles/Google_Workspace_Guide_EN.md) / [中文](./articles/Google_Workspace_Guide.md) |
| **From Prototype to Production** | Strategies for taking AI-generated prototypes and refactoring them into production-grade systems. | [English](./articles/From_Prototype_to_Production_EN.md) / [中文](./articles/From_Prototype_to_Production.md) |
| **The "Magic Tunnel" Workflow** | Zero-friction knowledge capture using the `mark` CLI command to teleport learnings from any window. | [English](./articles/Magic_Tunnel_Workflow.md) / [中文](./articles/Magic_Tunnel_Workflow_ZH.md) |

## 🛠 Usage
This guide is practical. Most articles come with **Configuration Files** (like `.cursorrules` or System Prompts) that you can directly copy-paste into your workflow.

## 🤝 Contribution
If you have found a better way to "tame the beast," please submit a PR. We are looking for:
- New Mental Models
- Battle-tested System Prompts
- Failure Stories (Post-mortems of AI-led disasters)

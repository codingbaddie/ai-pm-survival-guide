# 🧠 Learning Inbox
Use this file to dump raw thoughts, code snippets, or lessons learned from other projects.
I will periodically scan this file. When you tell me "Process my inbox", I will:
1. Read the content here.
2. Summarize it into a structured article (EN/ZH).
3. Update the main README.md.
4. Clear this file for your next session.

## Format
Just write! But if you can, use:
- `## Title of Topic`
- Bullet points for key takeaways
- Code blocks for examples
